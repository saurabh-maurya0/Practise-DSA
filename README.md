### Stacks

- Implementation of stacks and common operations.

### Queues

- Different types of queues, including priority queues.

### Trees

- Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and AVL trees.

### Graphs

- Representation of graphs and common algorithms like DFS and BFS.

### Hash Tables

- Basic hash table implementation and collision handling.

### Heaps

- Min and max heaps and heap sort.

## Algorithms

### Sorting

- Bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, etc.

### Searching

- Linear search, binary search, and variations.

### Recursion
